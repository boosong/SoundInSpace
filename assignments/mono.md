Your assignment this week is to create a monophonic playback piece. Consider the materials of your speakers and the position and placement of them in relation to the material they are playing. 

You _must_ document your piece and submit it by email before the start of class. 5 of you will show your documentation in class. Consider including in your documentation a score or some kind of graphical representation of the piece.
