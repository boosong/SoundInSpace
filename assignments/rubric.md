Your assignment is a short written statement which should include an itemized rubric that can be used for evaluating your final assignment. 

Please try and answer some of these questions: 

How should we (your classmates, community, wider public) listen to your work? What are we listening for? What do you aim to convey?

As an example, if you were a punk singer, you would not want to necessarily be judged on your pitch accuracy. instead you would want people to listen to your attitude and delivery as well as the symbolism of lyrics. On the other hand, an opera singer (esp one singing in another language) would might put in their rubric, diction, clarity and resonance.
