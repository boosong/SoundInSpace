Your assignment this week is to create a stereo playback piece. Consider the materials and placement of your speakers. With two speakers, consider how trajectories and movement influence the music. 

You _must_ document your piece and submit it by email before the start of class. Some of you will show your documentation in class. 

*Bonus points for submitting a score alongside your documentation.*
