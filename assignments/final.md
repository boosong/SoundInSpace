Create a piece for the 40 channel speaker system at Future Space. You piece should be played or performed for a maximum of 5 minutes. Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/2fi1p7MDZd9sfubU8) with some details about your piece. 

Your piece should use between 1-40 channels. You are not required to use all the speakers. A thoughtful musical performance is much better than a tech demo of 40 speakers. 

Be conservative with your ambitions, it'll give you much better chances of it working and working well when you get into the studio. Make sure you have an easily accessible volume knob and kill switch.
