> **What is Deep Listening**
>
> This question is answered in the process of practicing listening with the understanding that the complex wave forms continuously transmitted to the auditory cortex from the outside world by the ear require active engagement with attention. Prompted by experience and learning, listening takes place voluntarily. Listening is not the same as hearing and hearing is not the same as listening. The ear is constantly gathering and transmitting information--however attention to the auditory cortex can be tuned out. Very little of the information transmitted to the brain by the sense organs is perceived at the conscious level. Reactions can take place without consciousness.
