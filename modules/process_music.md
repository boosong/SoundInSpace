> The title translates as "actions through probability". In the case of "Pithoprakta," this relates to Jacque Bernoulli's law of large numbers which states that as the number of occurrences of a chance event increases, the more the average outcome approaches a determinate end. The piece is based on the statistical mechanics of gases, Gauss's law, or Brownian motion. Each instrument is conceived as a molecule obeying the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution law, with Gaussian distribution of temperature fluctuation.

Similarly, looking at a composition done in the [Twelve Tone Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique), it's easier to pick out and verify the prime, retrograde, inversion, etc, in the score than it is to hear those things in the realization.
