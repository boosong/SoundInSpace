Process-based music lends itself well to interaction and programming because rules can be coded and then realized through software. Consistent systems are also important for creating understandable listener interaction. 

Here's a few techniques drawn from 20th century music which can potentially be applied to Interactive Music. 

## Aleatoric

> Aleatoric music (from the Latin word alea, meaning "dice") is music in which some element of the composition is left to chance, and/or some primary element of a composed work's realization is left to the determination of its performer(s) [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music)


### Variations I - John Cage - 1958

* Points representing sound characteristics are placed on a board
* Lines are dropped on the board and the sound is interpreted by the proximity to the points.

> Six transparent sheets having single straight lines. Five having points. The sheets are to be superimposed partially or wholly separated on a suitable surface. Drop perpendiculars by means of any rule obtaining readings thereby for (1) frequency, (2) amplitude, (3) timbre, (4)duration, (5) point of occurrence in an established period of time, (6) structure of event (number of sounds making up an aggregate or constellation). A single use of all sheets yields thirty determinations.

## Stochastic

Stochastic music typically models a process (physical or otherwise) and leaves elements of that process up to chance.

> Stochastic comes from the Greek word στόχος, which means "aim". It also denotes a target stick; the pattern of arrows around a target stick stuck in a hillside is representative of what is stochastic. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic)


### Pithoprakta - Iannis Xenakis - 1956

* Mathematical processes based on probability that generate stochastic elements.
* Piece is based on statistical mechanics of gasses, Guassian distribution and Brownian Motion.
* Each instrument is conceived as a molecule obeying the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution law, with Gaussian distribution of temperature fluctuation.

## Process Music

### Piano Phase - Steve Riech - 1966

[Piano Phase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0345c6zNfM)

Process: 

1. Both performers play the pattern over and over again. One performer starts, the other fades in in unison (bars 1–2).
2. The first performer keeps a constant tempo. The other performer gradually increases his tempo, until he is one note ahead of the first performer (bar 3)
3. After playing in synchronization for a while, the second performer again begins increasing his tempo, and the phase shifting process starts again (bars 3–4)

Transfer of the phase shifting processes he explored in tape pieces like [It’s gonna Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vugqRAX7xQE) to live instrumental performance

## Open Form

### [In C - Terry Riley - 1964](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNi0bukYRnA)


* Each performer plays a measure for as long as they want and then goes onto the next one.
* [Score](http://www.flagmusic.com/content/clips/inc.pdf)

### Klavierstück XI - Karlheinz Stockhausen - 1955

* Klavierstück XI consists of 19 fragments spread over a single, large page. The performer may begin with any fragment, and continue to any other, proceeding through the labyrinth until a fragment has been reached for the third time, when the performance ends.
* Markings for tempo, dynamics, etc. at the end of each fragment are to be applied to the next fragment.

### _The Open Work_ - Umberto Eco - 1964

> ... the poetics of the "open work" tends to encourage "acts of conscious freedom" on the part of the performer and place [them] at the focal point of a network of limitless interrelations, among which [they] chooses to set up [their] own form without being influenced by an external necessity which definitively prescribes the organization of the work in hand. [The Open Work](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Work-Umberto-Eco/dp/0674639766)

 > Every performance _explains_ the composition but does not _exhaust_ it. Every performance makes the work an actuality, but is itself only complenmentary to all possible other performance of the work. [The Open Work](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Work-Umberto-Eco/dp/0674639766)

 
## Computer Assisted Improvisation

### [Interactive Trio](http://vimeo.com/23556704) - George Lewis - 2011

* Interactive performance system listens and responds to musical input. 
* Output is a transformation of the input material.

### Laurie Spiegel - Music Mouse - 1986

[Music Mouse by @teropa](https://teropa.info/musicmouse/)


* Software system which aids music composition in a specific style.
