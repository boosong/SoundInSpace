## Encoding/Decoding Audio

In typical recorded music, stereo output is assumed. Typically the encoder will test the sound against a few common decodings: headphones, car speakers, evenly spaced speakers at ear height. 

When passing a sound from the encoder (creator) to the decoder (listener), there are so many assumptions made on the part of the encoder. Standardization is assumed. In order to hear the sound as intended, the decoder must be using the same speakers, placed at the same position, in a similar sounding space. All of these affect the sound drastically, yet they are all just assumed.

Encoding and decoding of digital audio is extremely codified. Movie theaters try to meet specific requirements for placement and number of loudspeakers in order to satisfy film makers. 

### Instrumental Music

A symphony can also be seen as a type of encoding/decoding scheme. Composers write for _types_ of instruments and arrangements with the assumption that it will be distributed and decoded with a similar set of instruments. It's less common to write for a specific instrument and location. 

## [Encoding/decoding model of communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication)

The Encoding/decoding model of communication was first developed by cultural studies scholar Stuart Hall in 1973

> The encoding of a message is the production of the message. It is a system of coded meanings, and in order to create that, the sender needs to understand how the world is comprehensible to the members of the audience.

> The decoding of a message is how an audience member is able to understand, and interpret the message. It is a process of interpretation and translation of coded information into a comprehensible form. The audience is trying to reconstruct the idea by giving meanings to symbols and by interpreting the message as a whole. Effective communication is accomplished only when the message is received and understood in the intended way. However, it is still possible for the message recipient to understand a message in a completely different way from what the encoder was trying to convey. This is when "distortions" or "misunderstanding" arise from "lack of equivalence" between the two sides in communicative exchange.
