# A/D & D/A

## D/A

Convert the digital audio signals inside your computer to an analog signal.

## A/D

Takes analog signal from a microphone or instrument and samples it into a digital signal. 

### Sampling Rate

Any sampling rate above CD Quality (44.1k) is sufficient for the majority of audio applications. Remember that bit depth plays a much bigger role in signal-to-noise ratio than the sampling rate. Very high sampling rates such as 96k or 192k are useful only in a handful of cases such as when you need to be able to slow the audio down significantly or for certain audio processing plugins. 

## Audio Interface

An audio interface (somtimes called a Sound Card) is an important piece of equipment to understand for doing audio I/O for a concert, installation or instruments. The job of an audio interface is ADC and DAC. 

A typically audio interface will have at least 2 outputs. Many have up up to 16 or more. These are the outputs which you connect to your speakers

## Speakers

Speakers come in a range of sizes and types. The primary metric of speakers is their cone-size which is proportional to the frequency they can produce. Larger cones can produce lower frequencies. 

### Active

Active speakers are very easy to work with. They are self powered (i.e. have an "on" switch in the back) and have their own volume know typically. 

### Passive

Passive speakers have no built in amplifier and require a powered amplifier for them to make any sound. They are much less expensive than Active speakers. 

## Microphone

Microphones are defined by their transducer type (dynamic, condenser) and their directional pattern (cardioid, omni, shotgun). 

A dynamic microphone will only pick up signal which is very close to it. This is useful for loud and live situations to avoid feedback.
