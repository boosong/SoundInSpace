## [Karlheinz Stockhausen - Kontakte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjKVJ2z66fk)

> Kontakte is composed in four channels, with loudspeakers placed at the corners of a square surrounding the audience. With the aid of a "rotation table", consisting of a rotatable loudspeaker surrounded by four microphones, he was able to send sounds through and around the auditorium with unprecedented variety (Maconie 2005, 208â€“209).

A lot of our modern conception of spatialized listening comes from Karlheinz Stockhausen: 

> ...a spherical space which is fitted all around with loudspeakers. In the middle of this spherical space a sound-permeable, transparent platform would be suspended for the listeners. They could hear music composed for such standardized spaces coming from above, from below and from all points of the compass. (Stockhausen Texte, 1:153)

## [Pauline Oliveros - Deep Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoHuHBkT4es)

> In 1988, as a result of descending 14 feet into an underground cistern to make a recording, Oliveros coined the term "deep listening" ... "an aesthetic based upon principles of improvisation, electronic music, ritual, teaching and meditation. This aesthetic is designed to inspire both trained and untrained performers to practice the art of listening and responding to environmental conditions in solo and ensemble situations".

> ... I felt a connection between architecture and music: both art forms select and introduce materials, let them grow, give them form, prepare new contrasting elements, create different relations between the materials.

## [Dream House - La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC6bhnu5Luc)

Dream House is simply a handful of specially-tuned sine wave generators. As you move around in the space, the waves collide with each other in different waves changing the spectral content of what you hear. It's extremely responsive, interactive and uses entirely analog and passive electronics.

Similar to the Dream House, Microtonal Wall is an installation which the listener experiences by exploring a space.

## [Forty Part Motet - Janet Cardiff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIeulpigws)

Janet Cardiff's work often employs the technique of using speakers to embody people or characters. Her work is immersive and the interaction is simply moving around the space.
