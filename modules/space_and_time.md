# Space and Time

In their book _Space and Spatialization in Contemporary Music_, Maria Anna Harley illustrates how space and time are inextricably linked in the fields of literature, math, philosophy and music. All blurbs are from that book unless otherwise stated. 

### Literature

> A survey of definitions of space included in the Oxford English Dictionary brings forth the surprising conclusion that the predominant meaning of space is time... Jonathan Swift writes about the "space of ten hours"... Harriet Beecher Stowe about "a space to say something". 

### Philosophy of Science

> Hermann Weyl explains this unification  of the two formerly independent entities in the following manner: 
> The scene of action of reality is not a three-dimensional Euclidean space but rather a four dimensional world, in which space and time are linked together indissolubly... It is a four-dimensional continuum which is neither 'time' nor 'space'. Only the consciousness that passes on in one portion of this world experiences the detached piece which comes to meet it and passes behind it as history that is as a process which is going forward in time and takes place in space. (Weyl 1918)

> One of Minkowski's arguments for the validity of his theory of a unified four-dimensional continuum of space-time refers to human perceptual experience: "On one has yet observed a place to except at a time, nor yet a time except at a place". 

### Music

> Every melodic phrase, every chord, which can be executed at any pitch can be also executed at any other pitch in suc ha way that we immediately perceive the characteristic marks of their similarity... Such a close analogy consequently exists in all essential relations between the musical scale and space, that even alteration of pitch has a readily recognized and unmistakable resemblance to motion in space, and is often metaphorically terms the ascending or descending motion or progression of a part. Hence again, it becomes possible for motion in music to imitate the peculiar characteristics of motive forces in space, that is, to form an image of the various impulses and forces which lie at the root of motion. (Hemholtz 1863)

One obvious metaphor that we talk about with music is harmony as vertical and melody as horizontal. 

> GisÃ¨le Brelet attributes the compositional discovery of the spatiality of sound to "modern" times (after 1950s). Yet, there are ways in which music has always been spatial: in respect to the acoustic environment of its performance, the type and location of sound sources within this space, and the "lived" bodily-spatial experience of the listeners and performers. 

> Susan McClary writes, "a very strong tradition of Western musical thought has been devoted to defining music as the sound itself, erasing the physicality involved in both the making and reception of music".
