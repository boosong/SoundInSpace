# Setup

This is [Dave and Gabe's multichannel setup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QCbBvws8_j0vlMHpajGaoZQwtOMuOkzxz9NZf0LCQDw/edit#gid=0)

You'll see the xyz coordinates of all the speakers and a map of how the speakers are arranged. The easiest way to interface with the speakers is through a software called [Dante](https://www.audinate.com/products/software/dante-virtual-soundcard). This will give you up to 64 virtual audio outputs from your machine which travel over the network and are decoded with a special piece of Dante hardware that Dave and Gabe have hooked up to the system.
